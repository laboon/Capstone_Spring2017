## How To Sign Up For A Presentation

1. If you have not done so, create a GitHub user account.  You can do so by going to https://education.github.com/pack to create a new student account.  You can also create a regular account for this class (at https://github.com) but you do get lots of benefits by signing up for an educational account.
1. In your favorite web browser, go to https://github.com/laboon/Capstone_Spring2017
2. Click on `presentation_schedule.md`
3. In the upper-right hand part of the page, there are three buttons - Raw, Blame, and History.  Next to them is an icon of a pencil (for "Edit File").  Click on the pencil.
4. Edit the file to add your name to the appropriate list using the appropriate Markdown format.  In our case, this is two spaces, then an asterisk, and then your name.  You can look at the "Namey McNamerson" entry as an example.  Be sure to note what date you will be giving your presentation!
5. At the bottom of the screen, there is a box labeled "Commit Changes".  Click on the FIRST (upper) textbox and type your name in here.  Ignore the second (lower) textbox.
6. There are two radio buttons below the textboxes.  Ensure that the one labeled "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request." is selected.  This will create a new branch to be merged into the master branch (what everybody sees by default).  The default name for the branch is fine.
7. Click on the green "Propose file change" button.
8. A new screen will come up.  Just click on the "Crete pull request" button.
9. You are done!  Note that you have _proposed_ this date, I have not approved it.  Therefore, you will not see your name in the list until I have merged it to the master branch.  However, you can verify that it's there by clicking on the "Pull requests" tab at the top of the screen and checking that your name is listed.  These are the list of PRs (pull requests) that I have not yet merged.  I try to merge them to master as soon as I see them.
