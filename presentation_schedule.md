# Internship / Research Presentation Schedule

All CS1950 and CS1900 students (and BIOSC1640 students who did an internship) must sign up for a date to give a five to ten minute presentation on what they worked on.  All CS1980/CS1981 (and BIOSC1640 project student) _groups_ must give a ten to fifteen minute presentation to the rest of the class demonstrating their project.

Note that there is a limit on how many people can give a presentation on the same day.  This list is first-come, first-serve.  I reserve the right to move your preferred assignment of date, but will try to work this out with you beforehand to find a suitable date.

__Internship students__ - Please add your name as part of a pull request.  You can do this from the web.  Do not add more than five students per day.  I recommend that you give your talk as soon as possible; your semester is only going to get busier!

__Project students__ - please issue a PR for the _entire group_.  You will want to meet with your group to discuss this first, which means you must wait until at least 13 Jan to do so. Do not add more than four groups per day.

Add your name or group with two spaces and an asterisk before it under your preferred date, like so (be sure to leave blank lines before the first name and after the last name on the list):

  * Namey McNamerson
  * Namette Nameyname
